### TL, DR

```
In this work, we take a closer look at few-shot image generation (FSIG) problem. Our analysis discovers that: current methods for FSIG achieve similar quality of generated images after few-shot adaptation on target training images, while the main difference is on the diversity of those generated samples. State-of-the-art FSIG algorithms generates visual-pleasant images with both high-quality and high-diversity.

Based on our analysis, we propose a mutual-information based contrastive learning algorithm (DCL) that preserves the diversity of generated images during adaptation.
